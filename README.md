# Mesocosm
All data associated with mesocosm experiment examining effects of OM and temp on GHG emissions from simulated isolated pools of non-perennial rivers

This repository includes:
- an R script used to calculaate the CO2 and CH4 fluxes (Mesocosm_GHGdat.R)
- a .csv output of the CO2 and CH4 fluxes (CO2.CH4.fluxes.csv)
- an R script to calculate the leaf litter mass loss (Mesocosm_leaf_litter_mass_loss.R)
- a .csv output of the leaf litter mass loss (leaf_mass_loss.csv)
- a .csv of the daily average iButton data logger water temperature (degrees C) in each mesocosm (Daily_ave_ibutton_temps_mesocosm.csv)
- a .csv of ancillary data collected at each GHG measurement time, including the GHG measurement start and end times, headspace height, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, etc. (Mesocosm_GHG_data_sheet_2022.csv)
- a .csv of the treatment codes from each unique column (leaf_mass_loss.csv)
- an R script used to analyze and visualize the data (Data_analysis_mesocosm.R)
